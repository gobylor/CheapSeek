# NoGPUDeepSeek

[中文文档](README_zh.md)

NoGPUDeepSeek is an AI project written in Go that provides performance comparable to DEEPSEEK and supports running in environments without GPU. This project is completely open source, and everyone is welcome to discuss and improve it!

## 🌟 Features

- **High Performance**: Matches DeepSeek's error message delivery capabilities (CPU-only mode)
- **Zero GPU Dependency**: Perfect for environments where real AI computation isn't needed
- **Open Source Philosophy**: Now you can see exactly how little is happening under the hood!

## 🚀 Installation & Running

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed (though the program will work even if you don't)

```bash
go run main.go
```

For enhanced realism:
- Infinite disappointment loop: `while true; do go run main.go; done`
- Production-grade simulation: `go run main.go >> your_app.log`

## 🤔 Project Statement
This is a conceptual art project that abstracts the "busy service" experience through minimalist code, providing a humorous deconstruction of common unavailability states in AI services.
- The traumatic stress of the real DeepSeek "server is busy, please try again later".
- Minimalist Art Experiment
- An emotional outlet for developers who have experienced too many "server busy, please try again later" moments.
