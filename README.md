## ü§î Project Statement

This is a conceptual art project that uses minimalist code to abstractly represent the "Server Busy, Please Try Again Later" experience, humorously deconstructing the common unavailable states in AI services.
- Inspired by the trauma of DeepSeek's "Server Busy, Please Try Again Later"
- A minimalist art experiment
- Providing emotional outlet for developers who have experienced too many "Server Busy, Please Try Again Later" messages
